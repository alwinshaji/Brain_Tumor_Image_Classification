        "This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based system to classify brain MRI images into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The primary objective is to create an automated solution that can assist radiologists by reducing diagnostic time and improving efficiency. MRI scans often contain subtle variations that require significant expertise to interpret, and a model capable of accurately predicting tumor type can help streamline workflows, especially in resource-limited settings. By leveraging image preprocessing, data augmentation, and advanced CNN architectures, the system aims to handle variability in image quality and patient positioning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The planned approach involves building two types of models: a custom CNN to establish a baseline and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model for higher accuracy using transfer learning. Class imbalance will be addressed through class weights, and training will be monitored using early stopping, learning rate reduction, and checkpointing to prevent overfitting and optimize resource usage. Performance evaluation will include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix analysis, ensuring that the model’s reliability is thoroughly assessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, explainability is a key part of the plan. Visualization tools such as Grad-CAM will be integrated to highlight regions influencing predictions, building trust in the model’s decision-making process. The best-performing model will be saved in .h5 format for future deployment, and an interactive demo using Streamlit is envisioned to showcase real-time predictions. This approach not only targets technical accuracy but also prioritizes usability, interpretability, and real-world relevance in medical imaging applications.\n",
